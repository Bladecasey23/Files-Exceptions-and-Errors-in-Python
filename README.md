# Files-Exceptions-and-Errors-in-Python

This project demonstrates basic file handling in Python through two separate tasks:

---

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Description:
This script reads a file named `sample.txt` and prints its content line by line. It also includes error handling to gracefully manage the case where the file does not exist.

### Features:
- Opens and reads a file line by line.
- Handles `FileNotFoundError`.
- Displays an appropriate message if the file is missing.

---

### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

### Description:
This script performs three key operations on a file named output.txt:
Takes user input and writes it to the file (overwrites if file exists).
Takes additional user input and appends it to the file.
Reads and displays the entire content of the file.

### Features:
Uses `w` mode to write new content.
Uses `a` mode to append additional content.
Uses `r` mode to read and display final file content.
