# Files-Exceptions-and-Errors-in-Python

This project demonstrates basic file handling in Python through two separate tasks:

---

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Description:
This script reads a file named `sample.txt` and prints its content line by line. It also includes error handling to gracefully manage the case where the file does not exist.

### Features:
- Opens and reads a file line by line.
- Handles `FileNotFoundError`.
- Displays an appropriate message if the file is missing.
